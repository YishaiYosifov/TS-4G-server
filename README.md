## Screenshare
When you want to start a screenshare, you start a new connection, login as a screenshare and send the [start_screenshare](#start_screenshare_command) command. This command will send the target the [start_screenshare](#start_screenshare_action) action.

When the target receives this action, they will start a new connection and send the [init_target_screenshare](#init_target_screenshare_command) command, and start sending image data to the server, which will forward it to the host screenshare connection.

The image data is a pickled CV2 image. The first 8 bits of the data is the length of the image data.
## Roles
**0** - target

**1** - host, password is required

**2** - screenshare, password is required
